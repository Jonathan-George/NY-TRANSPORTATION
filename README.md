# NY-TRANSPORTATION

In this Data Analytics project, I answered the questions:
1) How strongly do weather conditions affect bike volumes? 
2) The relationship between the number of bicyclists who cross different bridges in New York. and
3)  What is the top bridge in terms of bike load?
using the New York City - East River Bicycle Crossings Datasets from Kaggle and applying the Poisson Regression Method

The results of my analysis show that High Temperature has a positive correlation with bike volumes on all the Bridges, while Low Temperature has a negative correlation wih bike volumes on all the Bridges.

I also highlighted the relationship between the number of bicyclists who cross different bridges in New York, using a Correlation Matrix, which showed the relationship the number of bicyclists on all 4 Bridges... I further verified the validity of my correlation matrix, using a Unit Test, which showed that my correlation matrix is correct.

Finally, my analysis shows that the top Bridge in terms of Bike Load is Williamsburg Bridge with asum total of 1021118 bike counts.
